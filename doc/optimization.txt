Optimization possibilities of maucisynth
----------------------------------------

Compiler optimization
GCC: -O2 -march=athlon-xp

Assembler optimization
* manual pointer loops
* use of MMX, SSE, SSE2 (SIMD instructions)
* use objdump to examine whether GCC can find uses for MMX/SSE/SSE2
  instructions with -O2 -march=athlon-xp

Processor cache usage
* Athlon XP 1600+ has 64 kb of L1 (data) cache and 256 kb of L2 cache.
  Wave tables take 3 * 4 * 4096 bytes = 48 kb.
  ADSR table might take just 2 * 4 * 1204 bytes = 8 kb.
  The smaller tables, the more likely they can be kept in memory.

Multicore
* Sounds of simultaneously playing oscillators could easily be calculated
  on different threads, each thread for one processor core.
